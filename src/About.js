      Full stack software developer with a strong enthusiasm for art and connectivity. With experience in JavaScript, React, and Ruby on Rails and a background in cataloguing art, I discovered web development through working at an auction software company. I bring strong skills in research and writing that help foster team productivity and collaboration. If Iâ€™m not in front of a computer or piece of art, you can find me hiking or biking somewhere with more trees than people.
